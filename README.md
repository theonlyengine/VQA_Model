## Model Summary

**MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5** is the latest model in the MiniCPM-V series. The model is built on SigLip-400M and Llama3-8B-Instruct with a total of 8B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement over MiniCPM-V 2.0. Notable features of MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 include:

- üî• **Leading Performance.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has achieved an average score of 65.1 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation over 11 popular benchmarks. **With only 8B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4V-1106, Gemini Pro, Claude 3 and Qwen-VL-Max** and greatly outperforms other Llama 3-based MLLMs.

- üí™ **Strong OCR Capabilities.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 can process images with any aspect ratio and up to 1.8 million pixels (e.g., 1344x1344), achieving an **700+ score on OCRBench, surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4V-0409, Qwen-VL-Max and Gemini Pro**. Based on recent user feedback, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has now enhanced full-text OCR extraction, table-to-markdown conversion, and other high-utility capabilities, and has further strengthened its instruction-following and complex reasoning abilities, enhancing multimodal interaction experiences.

- üèÜ **Trustworthy Behavior.**
  Leveraging the latest [RLAIF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLAIF-V/) method (the newest technology in the [RLHF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V) [CVPR'24] series), MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 exhibits more trustworthy behavior. It achieves **10.3%** hallucination rate on Object HalBench, lower than GPT-4V-1106 (13.6%), achieving the best-level performance within the open-source community.

- üåè **Multilingual Support.**
  Thanks to the strong multilingual capabilities of Llama 3 and the cross-lingual generalization technique from [VisCPM](https://github.com/OpenBMB/VisCPM), MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 extends its bilingual (Chinese-English) multimodal capabilities to **over 30 languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian etc.** [All Supported Languages](./assets/minicpm-llama-v-2-5_languages.md).

- üöÄ **Efficient Deployment.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 systematically employs **model quantization, CPU optimizations, NPU optimizations and compilation optimizations**, achieving high-efficiency deployment on edge devices. For mobile phones with Qualcomm chips, we have integrated the NPU acceleration framework QNN into llama.cpp for the first time. After systematic optimization, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has realized a **150-fold acceleration in multimodal large model end-side image encoding** and a **3-fold increase in language decoding speed**.

## Deployment on Mobile Phone
Coming soon.

## Usage
Inference using Huggingface transformers on NVIDIA GPUs. Requirements tested on python 3.10Ôºö
```
Pillow==10.1.0
torch==2.1.2
torchvision==0.16.2
transformers==4.40.0
sentencepiece==0.1.99
```

```python
# test.py
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5', trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
model = model.to(device='cuda')

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5', trust_remote_code=True)
model.eval()

image = Image.open('xx.jpg').convert('RGB')
question = 'What is in the image?'
msgs = [{'role': 'user', 'content': question}]

res = model.chat(
    image=image,
    msgs=msgs,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    sampling=True, # if sampling=False, beam_search will be used by default
    temperature=0.7Ôºå
    # system_prompt='' # pass system_prompt if needed
)
print(res)

## if you want to use streaming, please make sure sampling=True and stream=True
## the model.chat will return a generator
res = model.chat(
    image=image,
    msgs=msgs,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    sampling=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    stream=True
)

generated_text = ""
for new_text in res:
    generated_text += new_text
    print(new_text, flush=True, end='')
```
