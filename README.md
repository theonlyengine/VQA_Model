## MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5

**MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5** is the latest model in the MiniCPM-V series. The model is built on SigLip-400M and Llama3-8B-Instruct with a total of 8B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement over MiniCPM-V 2.0. Notable features of MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 include:

- üî• **Leading Performance.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has achieved an average score of 65.1 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation over 11 popular benchmarks. **It surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4V-1106, Gemini Pro, Qwen-VL-Max and Claude 3 with 8B parameters**, greatly outperforming other multimodal large models built on Llama 3.

- üí™ **Strong OCR Capabilities.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 can process images with any aspect ratio up to 1.8 million pixels, achieving an **700+ score on OCRBench, surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4V-0409, Qwen-VL-Max and Gemini Pro**. Based on recent user feedback, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has now enhanced full-text OCR extraction, table-to-markdown conversion, and other high-utility capabilities, and has further strengthened its instruction-following and complex reasoning abilities, enhancing multimodal interaction experiences.

- üèÜ **Trustworthy Behavior.**
  Leveraging the latest [RLAIF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V/RLAIF-V/) method (the newest technology in the [RLHF-V](https://github.com/RLHF-V) [CVPR'24] series), MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 exhibits trustworthy multimodal behavior. It achieves **10.3%** hallucination rate on Object HalBench, lower than GPT-4V-1106 (13.6%), achieving the best level within the open-source community.

- üåè **Multilingual Support.**
  Thanks to Llama 3‚Äôs robust multilingual capabilities and VisCPM's cross-lingual generalization technology, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 extends its foundational bilingual (Chinese-English) multimodal capabilities to support **30+ languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian etc.** We achieve this extension through only minimal instruction-tuning with translated multimodal data. [All Supported Languages](./assets/minicpm-llama-v-2-5_languages.md).

- üöÄ **Efficient Deployment.**
  MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 systematically employs **model quantization, CPU optimizations, NPU optimizations and compilation optimizations** as acceleration techniques, achieving high-efficiency deployment on edge devices. For mobile phones with Qualcomm chips, we have integrated the NPU acceleration framework QNN into llama.cpp for the first time. After systematic optimization, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 has realized a **150-fold acceleration in multimodal large model edge-side image encoding** and a **3-fold increase in language decoding speed**.
